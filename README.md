# How to calculate the probability of lethality of a whale-ship collision
This tutorial aims to demonstrate how to use the R package [whalestrike](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.06473) with AIS data for risk assessment of vessel strikes.

## whalestrike R package
The R package [whalestrike](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.06473) was created with the publication by [Kelley et al. (2021)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/mms.12745). The model simulates a collision between an adult North Atlantic right whale (*Eubalaena glacialis*) and a ship. Parameters such as the mass, the impact area, and the speed of the ships are required.
